          <h3 id="“奇妙盒子”是一款什么软件"><a href="#“奇妙盒子”是一款什么软件" class="headerlink" title="“奇妙盒子”是一款什么软件"></a>“奇妙盒子”是一款什么软件</h3><p>奇妙盒子 是一款纯图形化的程序设计工具，包括设计程序的界面和功能逻辑。 由iOS端和Mac端组成，两端配合使用才能达到最佳效果。</p>
<p>Mac端的 “奇妙盒子”是一款纯图形化程序设计软件。你不用写一行代码就可以制作出符合自己审美和使用习惯的程序。</p>
<p>iOS端的奇妙盒子 不包含设计功能，仅用来运行Mac端导出的工程包。 运行环境为纯原生，不包含任何H5或js相关的内容，所以不存在转换损耗。目前内置的任务管理工具就是通过Mac端制作的工程包，仅 20kb 大小。</p>
<h3 id="内置工程功能说明"><a href="#内置工程功能说明" class="headerlink" title="内置工程功能说明"></a>内置工程功能说明</h3><blockquote>
<p>为什么要内置一个工程包，而不是新手引导相关的内容 ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>考虑到真正复杂的操作在Mac端，iOS只做展示用，所以没有做新手引导。</p>
</li>
<li><p>目前这一类应用比较少，大部分人不习惯两端配合操作。如果用户没有兴趣去自己设计程序，仅包含引导和操作教程的iOS端将对他们没有用处。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>内置工程主要包含两个模块及两个扩展功能</p>
<ol>
<li>任务管理<ol>
<li>快速添加任务信息。支持设置提醒时间，可以快速设置n分钟之后提醒(如提醒日期不为当天，可在详情页设置提醒时间)</li>
<li>支持添加任务资源图片，图片会默认保存在文件管理中</li>
<li>支持关键字搜索任务</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>文件管理<ol>
<li>支持创建文件夹进行分类管理</li>
<li>目前支持所有格式文件的存储。图片、视频、音乐采用自定义控件播放。其余格式暂时使用系统控件预览，后期会逐步替换为专业浏览工具</li>
<li>支持文件的重命名，移动、删除、分享等功能</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>小组件<ol>
<li>添加了多个应用扫描的快捷启动 （目前不支持自定义，后面会改成新版小组件并支持自定义)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>自定义键盘<ol>
<li>远程输入。支持通过浏览器用键盘给手机打字。</li>
<li>电脑端实时显示手机剪贴板内容，可以一键复制</li>
<li>电脑端可以通过拖拽和点击选择文件 传输文件到手机。不用再打开特定app, 只要有输入框的地方就可以传输文件了</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>目前的自定义键盘支持三种类型。除上面的远程输入外，还包括</p>
<ol>
<li>可替代系统英文输入法<ul>
<li>系统英文输入法在输入邮箱等类型较多的内容时需要来回切换多次键盘类型，效率很低。所有我将数字和英文及常用符号合在一起，效果如下</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>配合电脑端的“奇妙盒子”你可以对该键盘进行更多的自定义，比如把快捷工具栏上的三个按钮改成emoji.  Mac端奇妙盒子编辑界面如下</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>计算器输入法。 支持各种复杂的数学运算</li>
</ol>
<p>​    同样，配合Mac端你可以自定义键盘数量及按键符号</p>
<p>​    关于奇妙盒子还有很多使用技巧，如果您有兴趣可以关注本站。当你对其足够熟悉之后，甚至可以做出任何你想做的App.</p>
